# opengl_in_c


One of the first tests I did to learn about writing an openGL app on Linux in C.

It makes a spinning cube and dynamically loads a texture.

Compile with "make"

When you run it press "d" or "c" to dynamically load textures on the cube. 



This was the first test of some code I wrote to give a "real time" view of image data 
that was coming in over a serial port for a DIY scanning electron microscope.
