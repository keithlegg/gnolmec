# opengl_in_c


One of the first tests I did to learn about writing an openGL app on Linux in C.


The original motirvation for writing this was I needed a way to display an image on the screen. 

The image was for a "real time" view of image data that was coming in over a serial port 
for a DIY scanning electron microscope. 

That propject ended, but this continues to live as a set of tools for playing with graphics and general nerdery.

Testes on Linux and OSX. 

clone, and simply compile with "make"

There are various hotkeys to do things, read main.py to see those.
