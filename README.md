# opengl_in_c


One of the first tests I did to learn about writing an openGL app on Linux in C.


My original motivation for writing this was that I needed a way to display an image on the screen in real time 
from some electronics that were scanning it and beaming the pixels in byte at a time. 

This is a branch of semraster (https://github.com/keithlegg/semraster), which is a snapshot of the 
project in some sort of working state. 

That project ended, but this continues to live as a set of tools for playing with graphics and general nerdery.


Tested on Linux and OSX. 

To use:
  - clone
  - simply compile with "make"


There are various hotkeys to do things, read main.c to see those.
