# opengl_in_c


A toolkit for 2D and 3D graphics in C. 

One of the first tests I did to learn about writing an openGL application on Linux in C.

My original motivation for writing this was that I needed a way to display an image on the screen in real time 
from some electronics that were driving a homemade electron microscope.

There is some really old serial port code in here, and I would like to revive it as well as hook up an FTDI driver
so we can have data flowing in/out to visualize cool things. 

For more info on the microscope project go here: (https://github.com/keithlegg/semraster) 


Tested on Linux and OSX. 

To use:
  - clone
  - simply compile with "make"


There are various hotkeys to do things, read main.c to see those.
