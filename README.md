# opengl_in_c


One of the first tests I did to learn about writing an openGL app on Linux in C.


The original motivation for writing this was I needed a way to display an image on the screen. 

The image was for a "real time" view of image data that was coming in over a serial port 
for a DIY scanning electron microscope. 

That propject ended, but this continues to live as a set of tools for playing with graphics and general nerdery.

Tested on Linux and OSX. 

To use:
  - clone
  - simply compile with "make"


There are various hotkeys to do things, read main.c to see those.
